## Welcome to Degendice.fun!

This is the open source code base of our website. We are a team of developers who are passionate about blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize the world. We are building a decentralized application (dApp) that will allow users to play a game of dice with a twist. Our game is called Degendice and it is built on the Solana blockchain. We use Orao network for VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to ensure that the game is fair and transparent.
